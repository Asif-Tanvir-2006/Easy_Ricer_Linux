# Easy_Ricer_Linux
A simple script that configures polybar and rofi according to the theme you'd choose and allows you to switch between themes  
## Important Note
Make sure that **polybar, rofi, and nitrogen** are installed (It should be there in the repositories of your distro)
## Steps for installation
* Clone the repository
* Make the installer script executable by running â†’ **chmod +x installer.sh**
* Run the installer script â†’ **./installer.sh**
* A folder named "Dashy_themes" should be created in your home directory
## Usage
* cd into the "Dashy_themes" folder â†’ **cd ~/Dashy_themes**
* Currently only two themes are available (cyan & red) but I plan on adding more in the future
* Run â†’ **./theme.sh _theme** (REPLACE 'theme' with the desired theme[cyan or red]) 
* Enjoy :)
